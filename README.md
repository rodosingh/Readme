Hi!, 
I'm a passionate data science enthusiast with extensive and in-depth programming, statistics, mathematics, and physics skills. I love developing data products, and with these skills above, I like to solve various real-world problems using machine learning, data mining, and other types of data analytics and data visualization tools, such as Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras. Besides, I'm proficient in R, Matlab, and web designing tools like HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. I've just started my career, about one year, in data analytics, data mining, and predictive modeling. I've done my summer project 2019 in IIT Mandi, where I learned GAN (Generative Adversarial Neural Nets) and used it to produce duplicate medical data, which is not that accurate but still can improve by choosing the right set of parameters. This model is used to address the problem of scarcity of data and hence saves us a lot of time and effort.

I've done both my undergrad and masters in IISER Kolkata, in Mathematics and Statistics. My final year MS project is about image analysis of geographical image obtained through radar or by any other means at ISI Kolkata.

I am very ardent about different applications of data science. And I believe, though I've started late, I will master a significant part of my ineterest.

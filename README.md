Hi!
Myself RODO.

I'm a passionate data science enthust. I love developing data products, and with these skills above, I like to solve various real-world problems using machine learning, data mining, and other types of data analytics and data visualization tools, such as Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras. Besides, I'm proficient in R, Matlab, and web designing tools like HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.

I've done both my undergrad and masters in IISER Kolkata, in Mathematics and Statistics. My final year MS project is about image analysis of geographical image obtained through radar or by any other means at ISI Kolkata. I am very ardent about different applications of data science.

Besides, I love to play badminton, go for marathon, painting (btw have a look at my insta [page](https://www.instagram.com/rodo.arts/)), rapping (yeah you read it right!), cooking, cycling and eatingðŸ˜‰.

Happy Coding ðŸ¤Ÿ.
